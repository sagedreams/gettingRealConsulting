To enroll, parents or guardians must submit an interest form through SchoolMint at https://greendotpublicschools.schoolmint.net to their school of choice. One interest form cannot be used for multiple children. If a school receives a number of interest forms that exceeds its capacity, a lottery will be held in December, depending on each school’s date and time slots. Green Dot does not have any admissions requirements and our schools accept students regardless of prior academic record, conduct, or socioeconomic background. To learn more about enrolling your child in our schools, visit our school websites or contact the school. What documents do I need? If a student is offered a seat, their parent or guardian must accept the offer before the specified deadline. Once the parent or guardian accepts the offer, they must complete the online registration form or request a hard copy from the school. Documents that are required for this process include:Birth CertificateImmunization Records (must be most recent immunization)Proof of AddressProof of Parent or Guardian Identification Can I apply to multiple schools? Yes, you can apply to several schools by filling out the interest form. What are the steps to apply? Submit an interest form online at https://greendotpublicschools.schoolmint.net or mail in a hard copy interest form. If your student is offered a seat, you will need to complete an enrollment packet online at https://greendotpublicschools.schoolmint.net. When is the deadline to apply for the 2024-25 school year?

Parents or guardians may attend the lottery, but it’s not mandatory. If you cannot attend the lottery, you will be notified of your child’s admittance status shortly after the lottery via mail.

Once all available seats have been filled, the lottery will continue to generate a waitlist. All remaining students are placed on the waitlist in the order their names were drawn. If space becomes available, students from the waitlist may be admitted. How will I be notified if my child is selected?

The Manual includes student policies that are intended to be user-friendly and provide insight into Green Dot’s culture, policies, and philosophies. Every situation is different, however, and individual circumstances often require individual solutions. Accordingly, this Manual provides guidelines and is not a contract. Green Dot may vary from any written policy in the Manual as necessary and as permissible by law. This Manual reflects Green Dot’s student policies at the time each policy was last revised. The policies with a “(Can be localized)” designation in the Table of Contents are recommended school policies. Any school-site specific additions or modifications to these recommended policies can be found in Section G: Localized Policies. All policies without this “(Can be localized)” designation are mandatory for all Green Dot schools.
