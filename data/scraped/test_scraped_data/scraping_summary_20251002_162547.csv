Learn More Don't show again Camino Nuevo Charter Academy Home Enroll Careers Donate Our Story Welcome No two kids learn the same way, and every family and community deserves high quality public education. That’s why, in 1999, the leaders of the Pueblo Nuevo Education and Development Group together with residents from the MacArthur Park community created Camino Nuevo Charter Academy (CNCA), a school built on the belief that every student should have the chance to go to a great school that puts their needs first, regardless of zip code, income, or ability level. Today, six CNCA schools across seven campuses are educating 3,200 students from early childhood through high school and proving that all children can learn and achieve when held to high expectations, exposed to rigorous and relevant learning experiences, and given targeted intervention and support in a safe and welcoming environment. At Camino Nuevo, all high school seniors graduate meeting admissions requirements for the University of California and California State University systems. In 2021, 76 percent of them enrolled in postsecondary education after graduation. While only 11 percent of low-income students nationwide earn a bachelor’s degree, that rate is more than three times higher for Camino Nuevo graduates. We pride ourselves on preparing all of our students for success in school, in college, and in life. Our schools have won state and national awards for improving outcomes for all students. In 2015, Camino Nuevo earned the Bright Spot Award from the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics for closing achievement gaps between English learners and native English speakers. In 2018, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools recognized our schools with a special induction into the Charter Schools Hall of Fame. Educational and economic inequities persist in our communities, but our resolve to reverse these disparities and change the trajectory of students' lives is stronger than ever. Join us in helping our students achieve their college and career dreams by becoming a mentor to our students, volunteering at our schools, or making an investment in our work.

OUR MISSIONWe educate students in a college- preparatory program to be literate, critical thinkers, and independent problem solvers who are agents of social justice with sensitivity toward the world around them. SUCCESS STARTS WITH US We believe that educating children is everyone’s job. Across our schools, nearly 500 staff members, from custodians to teachers, work hard to create safe and welcoming spaces for our students to learn. Our team is motivated by five core values or anchors: excellence, equity, community, innovation, and joy. A TRAUMA-INFORMED APPROACH TO TEACHING Our teachers are trained to track not just academic progress but also overall well-being. When emotional or behavior issues come up, a student is referred to a counselor for support. The Jeri Weiss Mental Health Program at Camino Nuevo gives students and families access to a variety of supportive services like individual therapy and peer support groups, so they can regain their well-being and focus on learning. ENRICHING STUDENTS’ LIVES We are committed to exposing students to meaningful learning experiences outside the classroom. These experiences build their confidence and resilience, and help them discover what is possible and open to them beyond their neighborhoods. Camino Nuevo Charter Academy 3435 W.

Welcome No two kids learn the same way, and every family and community deserves high quality public education. That’s why, in 1999, the leaders of the Pueblo Nuevo Education and Development Group together with residents from the MacArthur Park community created Camino Nuevo Charter Academy (CNCA), a school built on the belief that every student should have the chance to go to a great school that puts their needs first, regardless of zip code, income, or ability level. Today, six CNCA schools across seven campuses are educating 3,200 students from early childhood through high school and proving that all children can learn and achieve when held to high expectations, exposed to rigorous and relevant learning experiences, and given targeted intervention and support in a safe and welcoming environment. At Camino Nuevo, all high school seniors graduate meeting admissions requirements for the University of California and California State University systems. In 2021, 76 percent of them enrolled in postsecondary education after graduation. While only 11 percent of low-income students nationwide earn a bachelor’s degree, that rate is more than three times higher for Camino Nuevo graduates. We pride ourselves on preparing all of our students for success in school, in college, and in life. Our schools have won state and national awards for improving outcomes for all students. In 2015, Camino Nuevo earned the Bright Spot Award from the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics for closing achievement gaps between English learners and native English speakers. In 2018, the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools recognized our schools with a special induction into the Charter Schools Hall of Fame. Educational and economic inequities persist in our communities, but our resolve to reverse these disparities and change the trajectory of students' lives is stronger than ever. Join us in helping our students achieve their college and career dreams by becoming a mentor to our students, volunteering at our schools, or making an investment in our work. If you're a parent looking for a great school, apply today. We're free, public schools open to all students. We invite you to return to our website regularly and follow us on social media to learn more about our community. Thank you for visiting us. Camino Nuevo Charter Academy 3435 W.
